Click on Projects tab for app requirements and storyboard.

## Description
A cross platform (iOS and Android) app that allows users to create and manage a To-Do list.

## Technical Approach
Below are description of how we are tackling this project from a technical aspect.

### Source Control
- When starting on a new issue, create a branch for it and work from there.
- To create a branch... `git checkout -b issue_being_worked_on`
- After completing the code for your issue...
  - Add your changes... `git add .`
  - Commit your changes... `git commit -m "My commit message here"`
  - Push your changes... `git push`
    - If this is your first time pushing to the remote, you will need to setup the remote point. Just follow the text in the command prompt to do this.
  - Submit a pull request from GitHub for the branch you just pushed.
  - Zach will review the changes and approve or make comments
  - Start on next issue assigned with the now updated code :)
  
### Task Management
We are using GitHub's Issue and Project Board features for this project. [Here is our board](https://github.com/zacherygentry/CSE-4322-Project-3/projects/1).

- Use the board to know which issues to work on. The board is prioritized and each issue will be assigned to somebody.
- When starting on a new issue, drag the card into the Doing column
  - Once your task is complete and you submit a pull request, the issue will automatically be moved to Testing.
    - Here, Zach will test your feature and will approve the pull request if it looks good to go.
    - If it's good to go, the issue will then be moved to the Done column
  - After your task is complete, look under the Todo column to find your next task
- Rinse, repeat :)
